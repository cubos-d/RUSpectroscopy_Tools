	abstract = {When a system, composed of some substance, is displaced from equilibrium, the forces which were maintaining equilibrium will bring the system back toward equilibrium. Because of the mass of the substance, the system will overshoot equilibrium, then have to return, and subsequently the system will oscillate about equilibrium. This is the essence of acoustics, and it applies to virtually everything, from molecules to galaxies. In acoustic experiments, measurements of acoustic motion and damping, over a wide range of conditions, can be made to high precision and accuracy, and significant information may be obtained about the thermodynamics and interatomic forces involved in condensed matter physics.}

    abstract = {Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is used to nondestructively measure the elastic resonances of small solids to elucidate the material's elastic properties or other qualities like size, shape, or composition. Here, we introduce the software RUScal for the purpose of determining elastic properties by analyzing the eigenfrequencies of solid specimens with common shapes, such as rectangular parallelepipeds, cylinders (solid and hollow tube), ellipsoids, and octahedrons, as well as irregularly shaped ellipsoids that can be described analytically. All symmetry classes are supported, from isotropic to triclinic, along with the option to add or remove up to three orthogonal mirror planes as well as the ability to reorient the crystal axes with respect the sample edges via Euler angles. Additional features include tools to help find initial sets of elastic constants, including grid exploration and Monte Carlo methods, a tool to analyze frequencies as a function of sample length or crystal orientation, an error analysis tool to assess fit quality, and formatting of the input and output files for batch fitting, e.g., as a function of temperature. This software was validated with published resonant ultrasound spectroscopy data for various materials, shapes, and symmetries with noted improvements in calculation time compared to finite element methods.},

The paramount feature of this calculation, which distinguishes it from previous ones, is the choice of products of powers of the Cartesian coordinates as a basis for expansion of the displacement in a truncated complete set, enabling one to analytically evaluate the required matrix elements for these systems. Because these basis functions are products of powers of x, y, and z, this scheme is called the xyz algorithm. The xyz algorithm allows a general anisotropic elastic tensor with any position dependence and any shape with arbitrary density variation. A number of plots of resonance spectra of families of elastic objects are displayed as functions of relevant parameters, and, to illustrate the versatility of the method, the measured resonant frequencies of a precision machined but irregularly shaped sample of aluminum (called a potato) are compared with its computed normal modes. Applications to materials science and to seismology are mentioned.},

We describe here instrumentation and computational methods for acquiring and analyzing the resonant ultrasound spectrum of very small (0.001 cm3) samples as a function of temperature, and provide examples to demonstrate the power of the technique. The information acquired is in some cases comparable to that obtained from other more conventional ultrasonic measurement techniques, but one unique feature of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is that all moduli are determined simultaneously to very high accuracy. Thus in circumstances where high relative or absolute accuracy is required for very small crystalline or other anisotropic samples RUS can provide unique information. RUS is also sensitive to the fundamental symmetry of the object under test so that certain symmetry breaking effects are uniquely observable, and because transducers require neither couplant nor a flat surface, broken fragments of a material can be quickly screened for phase transitions and other temperature-dependent responses.}

The comparison of the calculated ECs for various types of cubic systems by this software with those from the other available softwares as well as experimentally measured results confirms that our code can predict reliable results. The success of our code originates from its use of single deformation. The other codes usually use rhombohedral strain (RS). RS leads to 3B0+4C44 expression. Hence, RS systematically adds error to the C44 through the bulk modulus calculations, and thereby may not be mathematically an appropriate approach. The total energy is accurately calculated by the WIEN2k within the highly accurate full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-waves plus local orbitals method. The ECs are calculated by the second-order derivatives of the fitted polynomials to the calculated total energies with respect to the elements of strain tensors at zero strains. We have presented the theoretical background and methodology of the cubic-elastic. We have validated the software by taking a variety of cubic samples into consideration and calculated their ECs. The zero bulk error calculations show that the results obtained from the cubic-elastic are in good agreement with the available experimental data and the previous theoretical results and predicts the sign of elastic constants correctly. The calculated Cauchy’s pressure (C″) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) of LaS predict that it is an ionic compound. This prediction is in agreement (disagreement) with the previous ionic (covalent) bonds prediction deduced from previous ν (C″).}

While Osborne and Water&amp;#x27;s efforts in raising awareness of the need to check assumptions.when using regression are laudable, we note that the original article contained at least two fairly important.misconceptions about the assumptions of multiple regression: Firstly, that multiple regression requires the.assumption of normally distributed variables; and secondly, that measurement errors necessarily cause.underestimation of simple regression coefficients. In this article, we clarify that multiple regression models.estimated using ordinary least squares require the assumption of normally distributed errors in order for.trustworthy inferences, at least in small samples, but not the assumption of normally distributed response or.predictor variables. Secondly, we point out that regression coefficients in simple regression models will be.biased (toward zero) estimates of the relationships between variables of interest when measurement error is.uncorrelated across those variables, but that when correlated measurement error is present, regression.coefficients may be either upwardly or downwardly biased. We conclude with a brief corrected summary of.the assumptions of multiple regression when using ordinary least squares.

Preprocessing data is a crucial step prior to modeling since data preparation can make or break a model's predictive ability. To illustrate general preprocessing techniques, we begin by introducing a cell segmentation data set (Section 3.1). This data set contains common predictor problems such as skewness, outliers, and missing values. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 review predictor transformations for single predictors and multiple predictors, respectively. In Section 3.4 we discuss several approaches for handling missing data. Other preprocessing steps may include removing (Section 3.5), adding (Section 3.6), or binning (Section 3.7) predictors, all of which must be done carefully so that predictive information is not lost or erroneous information is added to the data. The computing section (3.8) provides R syntax for the previously described preprocessing steps. Exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify concepts.",

	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {This work presents a novel multitask learning approach featuring a dual convolutional neural network (CNN) system for determining the elastic constants of orthotropic rolled steel sheets. In the proposed model, resonance frequency spectra from the impulse excitation technique are converted into 2D image data. The first CNN focuses on detecting and predicting missing peak intensities, while the second CNN utilizes features from the entire spectrum image to predict elastic constants, including E11, E22, and G12. The input features include raw pixel data alongside three key categories for enhanced analysis: image-based features (such as the mean, median, mode, and skewness of pixel intensity distributions), spatial relations (including spatial frequency, pixel intensity correlations, and local contrast), and geometric features (such as shape descriptors and pixel connectivity). The results reveal that the optimal number of peaks (14), image resolution (121 pixels), and sample size (20 × 20 × 0.3 cm) maximize the model’s efficiency. Under these conditions, the model achieves R2 values of 0.952, 0.902, and 0.913, and RMSE values of 1.89 GPa, 3.09 GPa, and 1.92 GPa for E11, E22, and G12, respectively. It is suggested that the superior prediction accuracy for E11 is attributed to the stability of the Young’s modulus along the rolling direction, which is less variable in orthotropic materials. Furthermore, the study finds a dependency between input weight functions—including image-based features, spatial relations, and geometric features—as the material’s anisotropy changes, underscoring the importance of accounting for process variability in predictive modeling.}

	abstract={We used deep-learning-based models to automatically obtain elastic moduli from resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) spectra, which conventionally require user intervention of published analysis codes. By strategically converting theoretical RUS spectra into their modulated fingerprints and using them as a dataset to train neural network models, we obtained models that successfully predicted both elastic moduli from theoretical test spectra of an isotropic material and from a measured steel RUS spectrum with up to 9.6{\%} missing resonances. We further trained modulated fingerprint-based models to resolve RUS spectra from yttrium--aluminum-garnet (YAG) ceramic samples with three elastic moduli. The resulting models were capable of retrieving all three elastic moduli from spectra with a maximum of 26{\%} missing frequencies. In summary, our modulated fingerprint method is an efficient tool to transform raw spectroscopy data and train neural network models with high accuracy and resistance to spectra distortion.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference with sequential Monte Carlo is used to quantify the orientation distribution function coefficients and to calculate the fully anisotropic elastic constants of additively manufactured specimens from only the experimentally-measured resonant frequencies. The parallelizable and open-source SMCPy Python package enabled Bayesian inference within this new modeling framework, resulting in an order of magnitude reduction of the computation time for an 8-core machine. Residual stress-induced shifts on the resonant frequencies were explicitly accounted for during the Bayesian inference, enabling the estimation of their effect on the resonant frequencies without a stress-relief heat treatment. Additively manufactured cobalt-nickel-base superalloy (SB-CoNi-10C) specimens were sectioned at multiple inclinations relative to the build direction and scanned with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to demonstrate characterization of any arbitrarily textured cubic microstructure through the resonant frequencies. The orientation distribution function coefficients of the textured polycrystalline microstructure were estimated in tensorial form to calculate both the 2nd order Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and the self-consistent estimate of the elastic constants, enabling accurate determination of all 21 possible independent elastic constants through the convergence constraints of the texture. Pole figures generated directly from the calculated texture coefficients showed good agreement with experimentally measured textures.}
