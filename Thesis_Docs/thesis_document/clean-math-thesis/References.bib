    abstract = {The Hamilton’s principle approach to the calculation of vibrational modes of elastic objects with free boundaries is exploited to compute the resonance frequencies of a variety of anisotropic elastic objects, including spheres, hemispheres, spheroids, ellipsoids, cylinders, eggs, shells, bells, sandwiches, parallelepipeds, cones, pyramids, prisms, tetrahedra, octahedra, and potatoes. The paramount feature of this calculation, which distinguishes it from previous ones, is the choice of products of powers of the Cartesian coordinates as a basis for expansion of the displacement in a truncated complete set, enabling one to analytically evaluate the required matrix elements for these systems. Because these basis functions are products of powers of x, y, and z, this scheme is called the xyz algorithm. The xyz algorithm allows a general anisotropic elastic tensor with any position dependence and any shape with arbitrary density variation. A number of plots of resonance spectra of families of elastic objects are displayed as functions of relevant parameters, and, to illustrate the versatility of the method, the measured resonant frequencies of a precision machined but irregularly shaped sample of aluminum (called a potato) are compared with its computed normal modes. Applications to materials science and to seismology are mentioned.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) involves the study of the mechanical resonances of solids. The resonant response of a particular object depends on its shape, elastic constants, crystallographic orientation, density, and dissipation. It is possible to obtain the complete elastic constant matrix of relatively low-symmetry materials from a RUS spectrum on a single small sample . The measurement and the computation of the RUS spectra of solids are reviewed. Several examples of the use of the technique are discussed.}

abstract = {The mechanical resonant response of a solid depends on its shape, density, elastic moduli and dissipation. We describe here instrumentation and computational methods for acquiring and analyzing the resonant ultrasound spectrum of very small (0.001 cm3) samples as a function of temperature, and provide examples to demonstrate the power of the technique. The information acquired is in some cases comparable to that obtained from other more conventional ultrasonic measurement techniques, but one unique feature of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is that all moduli are determined simultaneously to very high accuracy. Thus in circumstances where high relative or absolute accuracy is required for very small crystalline or other anisotropic samples RUS can provide unique information. RUS is also sensitive to the fundamental symmetry of the object under test so that certain symmetry breaking effects are uniquely observable, and because transducers require neither couplant nor a flat surface, broken fragments of a material can be quickly screened for phase transitions and other temperature-dependent responses.}

Experimental measurements of the 13 lowest‐frequency modes of a cube of fused quartz are all within 0.5\\% of the results computed by using the elastic constants determined by another method. These constants differ from the elastic constants determined directly from the experimental frequencies by less than 0.2\\% for the shear modulus and by less than 0.003 for the value of Poisson's ratio.

abstract = {In this paper we present details of our developed open source software, cubic-elastic, for the calculation of the elastic constants (ECs) of cubic crystals. The comparison of the calculated ECs for various types of cubic systems by this software with those from the other available softwares as well as experimentally measured results confirms that our code can predict reliable results. The success of our code originates from its use of single deformation. The other codes usually use rhombohedral strain (RS). RS leads to 3B0+4C44 expression. Hence, RS systematically adds error to the C44 through the bulk modulus calculations, and thereby may not be mathematically an appropriate approach. The total energy is accurately calculated by the WIEN2k within the highly accurate full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-waves plus local orbitals method. The ECs are calculated by the second-order derivatives of the fitted polynomials to the calculated total energies with respect to the elements of strain tensors at zero strains. We have presented the theoretical background and methodology of the cubic-elastic. We have validated the software by taking a variety of cubic samples into consideration and calculated their ECs. The zero bulk error calculations show that the results obtained from the cubic-elastic are in good agreement with the available experimental data and the previous theoretical results and predicts the sign of elastic constants correctly. The calculated Cauchy’s pressure (C″) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) of LaS predict that it is an ionic compound. This prediction is in agreement (disagreement) with the previous ionic (covalent) bonds prediction deduced from previous ν (C″).}
